# Fibonacci Function

### Explanation

#### Translation of the Question to English

The problem is about counting how many times ```0``` and ```1``` are printed when the Fibonacci function is called recursively to compute the N-th Fibonacci number. The function is defined such that it outputs ```0``` and ```1``` whenever n is 0 or 1, respectively.

You need to:

1. Take the number test Cases ```T```.
2. For each test case, compute how many time ```0``` and ```1``` are printed when calling ```fibonacci(N)```.
